# Weather App
This is a weather app I made useing openweathermap's API. Type in the name of a city and get realtime weather data.

## To Do
- The image showing if it is day or night is not correctly configured. This needs to be fixed.
- Add in more data to the info card.
- Add a weather symbol positioned infront of the day/night image displaying what kind of weather is in place. Eg, rain cloud for rain.
